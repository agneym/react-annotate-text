If after that your effect still ends up using functions in the render scope (including function from props), wrap them into useCallback where they’re defined, and repeat the process. Why does it matter? Functions can “see” values from props and state — so they participate in the data flow. There’s a more detailed answer in our FAQ. Question: Why do I sometimes get an infinite refetching loop? This can happen if you’re doing data fetching in an effect without the second dependencies argument. Without it, effects run after every render — and setting the state will trigger the effects again. An infinite loop may also happen if you specify a value that always changes in the dependency array. You can tell which one by removing them one by one. However, removing a dependency you use (or blindly specifying []) is usually the wrong fix. Instead, fix the problem at its source. For example, functions can cause this problem, and putting them inside effects, hoisting them out, or wrapping them with useCallback helps. To avoid recreating objects, useMemo can serve a similar purpose. hy do I sometimes get an old state or prop value inside my effect? Effects always “see” props and state from the render they were defined in. That helps prevent bugs but in some cases can be annoying. For those cases, you can explicitly maintain some value in a mutable ref (the linked article explains it at the end). If you think you’re seeing some props or state from an old render but don’t expect it, you probably missed some dependencies. Try using the lint rule to train yourself to see them. A few days, and it’ll be like a second nature to you. See also this answer in our FAQ. I hope this TLDR was helpful! Otherwise, let’s go. Each Render Has Its Own Props and State Before we can talk about effects, we need to talk about rendering. Here’s a counter.
